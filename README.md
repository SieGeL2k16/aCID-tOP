# WeekTop for FAME BBS

These are the sources for my acid-top (WeekTop) tool made for FAME BBS systems.


I've successfully compiled these sources with SAS/C 6.58 on my WinUAE system,
to compile just enter:

```
smake
```

To build the aCID-eDIT tool, change to the directory aCID-eDIT and again enter:

```
smake
```


Please note that you need the FAME SDK installed to successfully compile this code!

The original release archive can be found on my homepage:

Have fun,
